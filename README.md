             DEFINITIONS
FLUTTER DOCTOR- Flutter has Flutter Doctor command which guides developers through setting up the local development environment for both iOS and Android. Flutter Doctor inspects which tools are installed on the local machine and which tools need to be configured.
flutter create-Flutter Create is a contest where new and experienced developers can submit a project built using Flutter. It's a fun way to learn Flutter, try building out interfaces, and possibly win prizes
flutter run-The flutter run command will run your application on a connected device, or iOS simulator, or Android Emulator. You can also use --verbose command to get a detailed log while running the application.
flutter pub get-pub get is shorthand for the pub get packages which is how packages are downloaded in dart projects. Adding the flutter keyword before it makes it so that the command is run by the flutter SDK, which will map it to the sdk's packages get command.
flutter analyze-The flutter analyze command is a wrapper around the dartanalyzer tool. It performs static analysis of your code.
